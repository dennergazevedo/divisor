# Divisor

Welcome to the **Divisor** documentation.

**Divisor** is a **developer-first A/B testing platform**, built by the community — for the community.  
It was created to help teams **experiment, validate, and ship frontend changes with confidence**, without adding unnecessary complexity to their stack.

Divisor focuses on **clarity, control, and real-world usage**, enabling developers to run experiments where decisions matter most: **in the code**.

---

## 🧪 What is Divisor?

Divisor is a tool for running **A/B tests and feature experiments** in frontend applications.

It allows teams to:

- Safely test UI and UX changes
- Validate hypotheses with real user data
- Roll out features gradually
- Reduce risk when shipping changes
- Make product decisions backed by experiments

All while keeping **ownership in the hands of developers**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Built by developers, for developers

Divisor is designed with a strong opinion:

> Experimentation should feel like part of development — not a black box.

That means:

- No hidden logic
- No vendor lock-in mindset
- No magic UI-driven decisions

Everything is:
- Explicit
- Versionable
- Reviewable
- Testable

Just like code should be.

---

## 🧠 Core Principles

Divisor is guided by a few core ideas:

- **Code-first experimentation**  
  Experiments live close to your codebase.

- **Transparency over abstraction**  
  You always know which variant is running and why.

- **Incremental delivery**  
  Ship small, measure fast, iterate continuously.

- **Community-driven evolution**  
  Built openly, shaped by real-world use cases.

## 🔍 What you’ll find in this documentation

Here you’ll learn how to:

- Set up and run A/B tests
- Define experiments and variants
- Control traffic allocation
- Measure and evaluate results
- Integrate Divisor into real frontend architectures
- Apply experimentation safely at scale

This is **not marketing documentation** — it is a **practical guide** to building and running experiments.

---

## 👥 Who is this for?

Divisor is for:

- Frontend Engineers
- Tech Leads
- Product Engineers
- Teams running modern web applications
- Developers who care about experimentation and ownership

If you believe experimentation is an engineering concern, you’re in the right place.
